# MLOps Project

In this repo I am creating a basic scrapper to scrap texts from wikipedia.

These texts are forming a DataFrame in order to train a Naive-Bayes model to detect
what language a given sentence is.

On continue I am converting the model to a .py version in order to create an API endpoint with Flask and FastAPI.

Finally I use docker, and github actions for deployment purposes on Heroku

# Language Detection with Naive-Bayes 📚

This project creates a basic scraper to extract texts from Wikipedia in multiple languages. The texts are then used to form a DataFrame to train a Naive-Bayes model for language detection (English, Greek, Hindi, French, and more).

🎯 Features

📝 Scrapes text data from Wikipedia

💬 Trains a Naive-Bayes model for language detection

🌍 Detects multiple languages

🧪 Experiments with Docker, GitHub Actions, Flask, and FastAPI for deployment and API creation


❗ Notes
This is an experimental project to explore various deployment and API solutions.

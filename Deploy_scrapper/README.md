# Language Detection with Naive-Bayes 📚

This project creates a basic scraper to extract texts from Wikipedia in multiple languages. The texts are then used to form a DataFrame to train a Naive-Bayes model for language detection (English, Greek, Hindi, French, and more).

🎯 Features
📝 Scrapes text data from Wikipedia
💬 Trains a Naive-Bayes model for language detection
🌍 Detects multiple languages
🧪 Experiments with Docker, GitHub Actions, Flask, and FastAPI for deployment and API creation
🛠️ Setup
Install the required dependencies.
Run the scraper to gather text data.
Train the Naive-Bayes model using the data.
🚀 Deployment
Experimenting with Docker for containerization.
Using Flask and FastAPI for creating APIs to interact with the model.
GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.
❗ Notes
This is an experimental project to explore various deployment and API solutions.
